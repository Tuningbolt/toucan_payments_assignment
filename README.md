# Transaction Starter Project

This is the starter project for the Customer Transactions exercise.

## Before you start

The first thing you should do after cloning the repository is:

### Linux / macOS

```bash
./mvnw clean test
```

### Windows

```bat
mvnw.cmd clean test
```

The sample test should pass before you begin implementing the exercise.

## What is already provided

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Maven wrapper
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 embedded database
- JUnit / Spring Boot Test
- A sample REST endpoint: `GET /api/sample`
- A sample test that loads the Spring context


## Exercise

Implement these four operations:

1. Create transaction
2. Get transaction
3. Update transaction status
4. Get all transactions for a customer


You may change the surrounding design if you believe your solution is better.

## Transaction fields

Every transaction contains:

- Transaction ID
- Customer ID
- Amount
- Currency
- Transaction Type
- Transaction Status

### Validation rules

Define what makes a transaction valid. At minimum, consider:

- Transaction ID
- Customer ID
- Amount
- Currency
- Transaction type
- Initial status

Also explain any business validation you add beyond the annotations already supplied.

## API skeleton

  "amount": 150.75,
  "currency": "USD",
  "type": "DEPOSIT"
}
```

Example Response (`201 Created`):

```json
{
  "transactionId": "txn-001",
  "customerId": "cust-100",
  "amount": 150.75,
  "currency": "USD",
  "type": "DEPOSIT",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-01T03:46:00",
  "updatedAt": "2026-09-01T03:46:00"
}
```

### Get

`GET /api/transactions/{id}`

Example Response (`200 OK`):

```json
{
  "transactionId": "txn-001",
  "customerId": "cust-100",
  "amount": 150.75,
  "currency": "USD",
  "type": "DEPOSIT",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-01T03:46:00",
  "updatedAt": "2026-09-01T03:46:00"
}
```

### Update status

`PATCH /api/transactions/{id}/status`

Example Request Body:

```json
{
  "status": "COMPLETED"
}
```

Example Response (`200 OK`):

```json
{
  "transactionId": "txn-001",
  "customerId": "cust-100",
  "amount": 150.75,
  "currency": "USD",
  "type": "DEPOSIT",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-01T03:46:00",
  "updatedAt": "2026-09-01T03:46:05"
}
```

### Get customer transactions

`GET /api/transactions/customer/{customerId}`

Example Response (`200 OK`):

```json
[
  {
    "transactionId": "txn-001",
    "customerId": "cust-100",
    "amount": 150.75,
    "currency": "USD",
    "type": "DEPOSIT",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "createdAt": "2026-09-01T03:46:00",
    "updatedAt": "2026-09-01T03:46:05"
  }
]
```


## Testing expectations

Add at least four meaningful tests.

Your tests should cover more than just application startup. 

You decide exactly which tests provide the best coverage.
